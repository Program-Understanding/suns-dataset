The examples that are here, and why they are here:

switch-linear-no-pie-o2    -- as a no PIE, the table contains addresses

switch-disparate-bounded-pie-O2   -- as a PIE, the table contains offsets, the table is large

switch-consecutive -- there are two indirect branches that use the same table, tools should not get confused

array0.c

array-loop.c

array-modified.c  (but bring the swap in)

if-else-block.c


(consider different architectures or optimization levels?)
