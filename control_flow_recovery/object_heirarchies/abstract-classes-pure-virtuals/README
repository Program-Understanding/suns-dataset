Overview: This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of abstract classes and pure virtual functions in C++. Abstract classes serve as interfaces, defining a contract for derived classes by declaring pure virtual functions that must be overridden.

Contents:

C++ source files illustrating the declaration and implementation of abstract classes.

Examples showing how derived classes override pure virtual functions.

Purpose: To provide a clear understanding of how abstract classes and pure virtual functions are used to enforce interface contracts in C++.
