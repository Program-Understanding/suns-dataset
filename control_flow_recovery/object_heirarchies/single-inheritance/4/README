# Test 4: Factory Return Pattern

## Description
A function returns a `Base*` pointer that actually points to a `Derived` instance created inside the function.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The returned pointer is used for a virtual method call: `base->foo();`.

## Why It Matters
This pattern is common in real applications (e.g., factory or polymorphic API design). It tests interprocedural reasoning for class type recovery and vtable resolution.
