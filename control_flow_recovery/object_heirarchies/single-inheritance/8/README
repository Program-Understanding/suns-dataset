# Test 8: Virtual Call in Conditional Branch

## Description
A virtual call is placed inside an `if` statement, so the dispatch occurs conditionally.

## Indirect Control Flow
- Conditional branching precedes a virtual call: `if (flag) base->foo();`.

## Why It Matters
Introduces control dependence and tests whether the tools can still recover ICF paths when not all execution paths include dispatch.
