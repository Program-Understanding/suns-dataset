This directory holds examples that represent common control flow recovery challenges

TODO list:
- brooke-fptr-array example is missing CFR
- one more callback example that uses OS-based callbacks
- maybe make one exceptional control flow example, it would be very difficult though
- move conditionally-called into the stack-allocated-function-pointer folder
- make a new sample that uses global function pointers (allocated as global, set and used in different functions)
- make advanced heap-allocated function pointer example where initialization and allocation happen in different functions
- fix CFR for add1_or_mult2
- add examples of different switch statement layouts (in binary; i.e. from different compilers)
- additional threading example with a different programming pattern
- fix userinput-class CFR to have just 1 question
- add virtual function call example where type heirarchy could resolve to multiple things, but dataflow shows it can only possibly resolve to one target
