This directory holds examples that represent common control flow recovery challenges

TODO list:
- brooke-fptr-array example is missing CFR --done
- one more callback example that uses OS-based callbacks --done
- maybe make one exceptional control flow example, it would be very difficult though --done 
- move conditionally-called into the stack-allocated-function-pointer folder --done
- make a new sample that uses global function pointers (allocated as global, set and used in different functions) --done
- make advanced heap-allocated function pointer example where initialization and allocation happen in different functions --done
- fix CFR for add1_or_mult2 --done
- add examples of different switch statement layouts (in binary; i.e. from different compilers) (pending fixing the compiler library)
- additional threading example with a different programming pattern --done
- fix userinput-class CFR to have just 1 question --done
- add virtual function call example where type heirarchy could resolve to multiple things, but dataflow shows it can only possibly resolve to one target --done
