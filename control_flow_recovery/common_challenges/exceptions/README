This directory holds examples that conform to the type of control flow recovery specified in the directories name

The existing examples are here are good for showing code that has indirect branching with exceptions involved in it,
but the indirect control flow we want to test is the exception handling itself (e.g. the control flow from "throw" to
"catch.") This is tricky because exception handling is handled differently depending on the language. In C++, exceptions
are handled through a library that does all of the "try/catch/throw" logic, and so exceptional control flow in C++ will
actually occur inside stdlib.

I'm still thinking over what we should do here. We need an example that shows exceptional control flow, but it may not
be perfectly representable in the way we write CFG questions right now.
