The general plan is to take work done at SNL and make it a bit more generic.

Each analysis "tool" will be in a separate directory.
Each directory will contain "questions.json" which are questions the tool believes it can answer.
Each cfr file (in the datasets) may have one or more corresponding -tool-cfrs.json file,
where the "cfrs" is a cfr file that specifies a "script" (s) designed to solve the specific
question.

Generally, tools prefer to have generic scripts...one does not need a special script for
each and every tool...however, sometimes you do...and thus

analysis

checks to see if there are one or more "cfrs" file... and then it will simply run that for the
tool in question... and won't run the generic script...otherwise, it checks to see for each
tool if the tool is willing to answer the question, and then if so, uses a generic script
for that question.

Wait to see the details...it will make more sense when this is all concrete
