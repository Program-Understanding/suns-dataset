Function argument information has been propagated
The initial autoanalysis has been finished.
Found the offset we care about!
RESULT: 0x4f8
OTHER RESULT? Ordinary_Flow 0x1000005bc 0x1000005c0
OTHER RESULT? Code_Near_Call 0x1000005bc 0x1000004f8
Done
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'blr x8' instruction at file offset '0x5bc' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x500}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x4f8}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
Tool's answer includes falsePositive elements: {'0x4f8'}
Tool's answer does not include correct elements: {'0x500'}
RESULTS: SUMMARY: WRONG+1-1
