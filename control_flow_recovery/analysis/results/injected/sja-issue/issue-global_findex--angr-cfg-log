adding address due to cfg successor 0x401167
adding address due to cfg successor 0x401149
adding address due to cfg successor 0x401158
ran a reaching definition analysis
found a symbolic reaching value: <BV64 TOP>
for address 0x401158 offset is 0x1158
for address 0x401149 offset is 0x1149
for address 0x401167 offset is 0x1167
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'call rdx' instruction at file offset '0x11de' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1158}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x1149, 0x1158, 0x1167}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
Tool's answer includes falsePositive elements: {'0x1149', '0x1167'}
Tool's answer does not include correct elements: {}
RESULTS: SUMMARY: OVER+2
