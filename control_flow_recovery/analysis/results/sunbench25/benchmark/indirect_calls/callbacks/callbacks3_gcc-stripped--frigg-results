RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x1034' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1140, 0x1150}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
RESULTS: SUMMARY: EMPTY
RESULTS: Running time: 8 seconds
RESULTS: Tool name:frigg
RESULTS: Tool version:1.1.6
RESULTS:      (not the version of the underlying tool, but of the script that invokes it)
RESULTS:      (see the tool itself to find which underlying tools it uses and their versions)
