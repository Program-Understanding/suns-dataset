RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'call r13' instruction at file offset '0x11d5' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1130, 0x1140, 0x1150}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x1130}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
Tool's answer includes falsePositive elements: {}
Tool's answer does not include correct elements: {'0x1150', '0x1140'}
RESULTS: SUMMARY: UNDER-2
RESULTS: Running time: 8 seconds
RESULTS: Tool name:frigg
RESULTS: Tool version:1.1.6
RESULTS:      (not the version of the underlying tool, but of the script that invokes it)
RESULTS:      (see the tool itself to find which underlying tools it uses and their versions)
