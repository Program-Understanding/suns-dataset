The virtual address answers are ['0x11a1', '0x1162', '0x116b', '0x1174', '0x117d', '0x1186', '0x118f', '0x1198']
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x115f' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1162, 0x116b, 0x1174, 0x117d, 0x1186, 0x118f, 0x1198, 0x11a1}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x1162, 0x116b, 0x1174, 0x117d, 0x1186, 0x118f, 0x1198, 0x11a1}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
