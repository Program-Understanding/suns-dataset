The virtual address answers are ['0x1189', '0x1192', '0x1165', '0x116e', '0x1177', '0x1180']
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x1162' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1165, 0x116e, 0x1177, 0x1180, 0x1189, 0x1192}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x1165, 0x116e, 0x1177, 0x1180, 0x1189, 0x1192}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
