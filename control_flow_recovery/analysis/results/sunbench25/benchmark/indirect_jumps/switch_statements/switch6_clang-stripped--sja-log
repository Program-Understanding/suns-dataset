The virtual address answers are ['0x114b', '0x1172', '0x1178', '0x116c', '0x117e', '0x1184', '0x118a']
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x1149' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x114b, 0x116c, 0x1172, 0x1178, 0x117e, 0x1184, 0x118a}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x114b, 0x116c, 0x1172, 0x1178, 0x117e, 0x1184, 0x118a}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
