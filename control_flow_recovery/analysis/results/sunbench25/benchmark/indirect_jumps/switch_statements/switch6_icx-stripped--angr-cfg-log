adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011cc
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011d8
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011d2
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011de
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011ea
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011b4
adding address due to cfg successor 0x4011f0
Not able to do reaching definition analysis which for now only works if the target is a simple register
for address 0x4011ea offset is 0x11ea
for address 0x4011cc offset is 0x11cc
for address 0x4011f0 offset is 0x11f0
for address 0x4011d2 offset is 0x11d2
for address 0x4011b4 offset is 0x11b4
for address 0x4011d8 offset is 0x11d8
for address 0x4011de offset is 0x11de
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp qword ptr [rax*8 + 0x402080]' instruction at file offset '0x11ad' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x11b4, 0x11cc, 0x11d2, 0x11d8, 0x11de, 0x11ea, 0x11f0}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x11b4, 0x11cc, 0x11d2, 0x11d8, 0x11de, 0x11ea, 0x11f0}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
