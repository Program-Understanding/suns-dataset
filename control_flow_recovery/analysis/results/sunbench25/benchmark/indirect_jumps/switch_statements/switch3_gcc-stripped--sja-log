The virtual address answers are ['0x1180', '0x115e', '0x1167', '0x1170', '0x1179']
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x115b' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x115e, 0x1167, 0x1170, 0x1179, 0x1180}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x115e, 0x1167, 0x1170, 0x1179, 0x1180}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
