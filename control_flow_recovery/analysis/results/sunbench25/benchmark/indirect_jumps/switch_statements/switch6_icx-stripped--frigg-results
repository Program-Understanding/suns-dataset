RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp qword ptr [rax*8 + 0x402028]' instruction at file offset '0x11ad' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x11b4, 0x11cc, 0x11d2, 0x11d8, 0x11de, 0x11ea, 0x11f0}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
RESULTS: SUMMARY: EMPTY
RESULTS: Running time: 9 seconds
RESULTS: Tool name:frigg
RESULTS: Tool version:1.1.6
RESULTS:      (not the version of the underlying tool, but of the script that invokes it)
RESULTS:      (see the tool itself to find which underlying tools it uses and their versions)
