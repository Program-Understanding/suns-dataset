The virtual address answers are ['0x1160', '0x1165', '0x1171', '0x1190', '0x117d', '0x1189']
RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x115e' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1160, 0x1165, 0x1171, 0x117d, 0x1189, 0x1190}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x1160, 0x1165, 0x1171, 0x117d, 0x1189, 0x1190}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? YES
RESULTS: SUMMARY: RIGHT
