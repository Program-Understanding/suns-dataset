RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp dword ptr [edx*4 + 0x4010a4]' instruction at file offset '0x22e' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x235, 0x23e, 0x24b, 0x256, 0x25f, 0x270, 0x28a, 0x2a4}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {0x235, 0x23e, 0x24b, 0x256, 0x25f, 0x270, 0x28a}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
