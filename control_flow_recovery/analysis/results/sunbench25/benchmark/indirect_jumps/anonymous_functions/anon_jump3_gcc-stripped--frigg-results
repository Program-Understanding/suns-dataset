RESULTS: For question 'What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'jmp rax' instruction at file offset '0x11fb' ?'
RESULTS: The groundtruth is: {0x1310, 0x1320, 0x1330, 0x1340, 0x1350, 0x1360, 0x1370, 0x1380, 0x1390, 0x13a0}
RESULTS: The tool's answer is: {}
RESULTS: Tool's answer matches groundtruth? NO
