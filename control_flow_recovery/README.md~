# Control Flow Recovery Dataset

This folder contains subfolders that contain datasets useful for exploring
the subject of control flow recovery.  There a few suggested guidelines
for anyone adding datasets to this directory.

Most importantly, any control flow recovery questions and ground
truth should be placed into a file that ends with "cfr.json"
Thus, files could be "abc-cfr.json" or just "cfr.json" -- you
can have multiple files in a single directory if you wish.
Each "[optional]cfr.json" file should contain properties that
define a control flow recovery question about a specific binary,
and ground truth.  These properties are:

"groundtruth"
"program"
"question"
"evaluation"

The program points to the binary, typically located in the same folder.
The "groundthruth" can be anything, but typically is a list of addresses.
THe "evaluation" specifies how to evaluate the ground-truth, typically
it is "set" saying that the list of ground-truth is not ordered.
The "question" is human readable but typically conforms to known questions
that tools recognize they are suited to answer.  The question typically
uses file offsets to refer to instructions in the binary.  Because file
offsets are not intuitive, the question often include validation information,
and by default uses capstone instruction syntax.  Thus, a sample question is:

"What are the file offsets for the instructions that are the targets of the 'call rax' instruction at file offset 0x1297?"

Note that tools may pattern match against this question but ignore the dissassemble they might
not care about the 'call rax' because it is a portion of the question designed for human validation, not pattern
matching.

Perhaps tool creators will dictate the types of questions they can answer, and dataset creators will follow
suit, or perhaps dataset creators will craft datasets and expect tools to accomadate... For now, both options
are a possibility, though we suggest readers take a look at existing "cfr.json" files to get a sense of how this
all might work.
