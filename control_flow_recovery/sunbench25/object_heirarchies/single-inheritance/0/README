# Test 0: Minimal Virtual Call

## Description
The simplest possible virtual dispatch scenario:
- A `Base` class declares a virtual method.
- `Derived` overrides it.
- A stack-allocated `Derived` object is used through a `Base*` pointer.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The line `base->foo();` triggers a virtual call through the vtable.
- The compiler emits an indirect jump based on the vtable for `Derived`.

## Why It Matters
This test serves as a minimal sanity check:
- Is the tool detecting basic vtable dispatch?
- Are function call targets recovered?
This test does not aim to test robustnessâ€”only fundamental correctness.
