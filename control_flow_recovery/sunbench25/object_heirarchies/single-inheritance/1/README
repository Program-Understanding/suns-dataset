# Test 1: Virtual Call via Base Pointer

## Description
This test uses single inheritance where a `Derived` object is accessed via a `Base*` pointer.
The virtual method is overridden in `Derived`.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The call `base_ptr->foo();` leads to indirect control flow via the vtable.

## Why It Matters
This is a canonical virtual dispatch pattern and serves as a basic case for vtable-based ICF recognition.
