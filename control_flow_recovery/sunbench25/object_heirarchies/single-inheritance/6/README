# Test 6: Virtual Call in Loop

## Description
A single virtual call is made inside a loop, repeatedly invoking the same method on a single object.

## Indirect Control Flow
- Each loop iteration makes an indirect call via the vtable.

## Why It Matters
Tests whether tools can correctly interpret recurring control flow patterns where the ICF remains constant but is embedded in iterative logic.
