# Test 3: Heap Allocation

## Description
A `Derived` object is created using `new`, and its address is stored in a `Base*`.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The virtual call is made via a pointer to heap memory: `base->foo();`.

## Why It Matters
Heap allocation obscures type instantiation in memory. This test helps determine if tools can recover class hierarchies and dispatch behavior in dynamically allocated contexts.
