# Test 2: Virtual Call via Reference

## Description
A `Derived` object is accessed via a `Base&` reference rather than a pointer.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The call `base_ref.foo();` invokes the overridden method through a vtable.

## Why It Matters
This variation evaluates tools' ability to track vtable usage when virtual dispatch is done via a reference, which may obscure callsite semantics slightly.
