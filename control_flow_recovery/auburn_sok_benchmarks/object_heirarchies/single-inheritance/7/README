# Test 7: Inline Function Dispatch

## Description
The virtual call is made within an inline helper function, wrapping the dispatch site.

## Indirect Control Flow
- Indirect control flow is abstracted through a helper function: `callVirtual(base);`.

## Why It Matters
Inlining can obscure the dispatch origin or make the vtable callsite harder to identify. This test highlights whether tools respect callsite inlining.
