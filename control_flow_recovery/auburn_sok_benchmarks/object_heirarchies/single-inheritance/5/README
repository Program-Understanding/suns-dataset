# Test 5: Object Array Dispatch

## Description
An array of `Base*` pointers is populated with multiple `Derived` instances.
Each entry in the array is used to invoke a virtual method.

## Indirect Control Flow
- The call `ptrs[i]->foo();` inside a loop results in multiple ICF points from a uniform memory pattern.

## Why It Matters
This test reflects common usage in virtualized data structures (e.g., game entities, renderables). It stresses consistency of dispatch resolution across objects in memory.
