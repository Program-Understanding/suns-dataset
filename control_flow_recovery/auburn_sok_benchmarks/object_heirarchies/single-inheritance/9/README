# Test 9: Multiple Virtual Method Calls

## Description
Two virtual methods are called on the same object instance via a base pointer.

## Indirect Control Flow
- Both `foo()` and `bar()` are virtual and called from the same site, triggering two separate vtable lookups and indirect calls.

## Why It Matters
Tests resolution of multiple ICF sites in one scope, stressing tool precision when handling multiple vtable entries and tracking multiple targets.
