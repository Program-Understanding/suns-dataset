In addition to the core control flow recovery challenges, there are a number of software constructs that can make
control flow recovery difficult indirectly, which are also relevant for measuring successful control flow recovery.
These constructs should also be present in the critical control flow recovery data path for some samples to simulate
those conditions.  In other words, the folders in this directory are more about the software constructs present in
the sample than they are about the core challenge
