# SUNS Dataset

This is the repository for the SUNS 2025 Benchmark Dataset. This dataset contains:

- Source code, binaries, and ground truth for the SUNS 2025 Control Flow Recovery Benchmark.
- Source code for our tool evaluation framework.
- Source code for our web-based results viewer.
- Some brief [documentation](docs/control_flow_recovery/ToC.md) of the above.

NOTE: This repository is a work in progress. Directory structure and ground truth format are both subject to change at any time.

## Whoami

This dataset is an organized collection of source code (and programs) featuring constructs that may be of interest to binary analysis researchers and anyone looking to measure software understanding and control flow recovery capabilities.
